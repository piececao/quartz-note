# About Quartz
Quartz is a fast, batteries-included static-site generator that transforms Markdown content into fully functional websites. Thousands of students, developers, and teachers publish personal notes, wikis, and [digital gardens](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/networked-thought) to the web.

See the [official documentation](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) for more details.
